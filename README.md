This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file developed in Google Colab. The notebook implements a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which consists of images of traffic signs along with their corresponding labels. The dataset can be found at: [GTSRB dataset](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html)

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook file (traffic_sign_classification.ipynb) using Google Colab. You can either upload the notebook to Colab or directly open it from a GitHub link.
- Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe the training and evaluation process.

Please note that this Jupyter Notebook is specifically designed to be run in Google Colab, as it may rely on specific Colab functionalities, pre-installed packages, or access to cloud resources. Running the notebook in a local Jupyter Notebook environment might require additional configuration and package installations.

## Further Improvements
While achieving a 97.5% test accuracy is commendable, there is always room for improvement. Here are a few ideas to enhance the model and its performance:

- Experiment with different CNN architectures, such as adding more convolutional or pooling layers, or exploring different activation functions.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, potentially improving the model's generalization capabilities.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning to find optimal values for learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques.
- Investigate techniques like transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models to boost the performance of the traffic sign classification task.

Should you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. I am open to discussing my methodologies and sharing further insights into this project.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
